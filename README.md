# pub

This is my [US Air Force](http://www.e-publishing.af.mil/) policy and regulation [search engine](https://that.pub).  It exists as the primary "I told you so" tool.

----

Lots of stuff gets added and removed periodically and plenty more stuff can be changed to improve it (requirejs, not using SASS/SCSS for such minor amounts of CSS, etc) but that's why it's here.  That and I just lost some stuff so now I needa store this somewhere it'll last a relatively long time.

## Primary goals
- Load faster than `about:blank`
- Great user experience (UX)
- Cute as fuck
- Prove I can do some shit
- Expansion in the future

This pairs with its [counterpart/back-end here](https://github.com/thatpub/pubs).
